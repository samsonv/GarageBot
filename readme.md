# What is this?
A very simple Node app for Raspberry Pi that talks with the web as a socket.io-client and talks with the world using either via the RaspPi's GPIO (using the onoff GPIO npm package) or trough an Ardunio (using Johnny Five). 

# Usage
1. git clone git://github.com/samsonv/GarageBot.git
2. run 'npm install' and then run 'node app.js <your-server-address-here>'
